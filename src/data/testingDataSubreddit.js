The research was widely shared on social media and featured prominently by certain Substack writers, predominantly because of its headline-grabbing claims about COVID-19 vaccine-related fatalities. At the time of its retraction, the paper was the most viewed publication in the journal's history and the 850th highest-scoring article [tracked by Altmetric](https://bmc.altmetric.com/details/141737291).\n\nFollowing publication, [serious concerns](https://www.respectfulinsolence.com/2023/01/25/economist-mark-skidmore-publishes-antivax-propaganda-disguised-as-a-survey/) about the methodology and the validity of the conclusions were raised, prompting a re-review by members of the *BMC Infectious Disease* editorial board. This post-publication peer review found that the methodology was inappropriate for proving causal inference of mortality and that the limitations were not adequately described. Critical issues were identified with the accuracy of data collection since there was no attempt to validate reported fatalities. Furthermore, the paper falsely stated that the research had been approved by the IRB of the Michigan State University Human Research Protection Program when in fact the study was exempt from such ethics approval. Given the significant methodological concerns that undermine the study's most prominent conclusions, the Editors retracted the article against the wishes of the author.\n\n* The Chronicle of Higher Education: [This Questionable Study Caught Fire in Anti-Vaccine Circles.
